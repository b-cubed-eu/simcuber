The goal of **gcube** is to provide a simulation framework for
biodiversity data cubes using the R programming language. This can start
from simulating multiple species distributed in a landscape over a
temporal scope. In a second phase, the simulation of a variety of
observation processes and effort can generate actual occurrence
datasets. Based on their (simulated) spatial uncertainty, occurrences
can then be designated to a grid to form a data cube.

Simulation studies offer numerous benefits due to their ability to mimic
real-world scenarios in controlled and customizable environments.
Ecosystems and biodiversity data are very complex and involve a
multitude of interacting factors. Simulations allow researchers to model
and understand the complexity of ecological systems by varying
parameters such as spatial and/or temporal clustering, species
prevalence, etc.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("b-cubed-eu/gcube")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you the workflow for simulating a
biodiversity data cube. This is divided in three steps or processes:

1.  Occurrence process
2.  Detection process
3.  Grid designation process

The functions are set up such that a single polygon as input is enough
to go through this workflow using default arguments. The user can change
these arguments to allow for more flexibility.

``` r
# Load packages
library(gcube)

library(sf)      # working with spatial objects
library(dplyr)   # data wrangling
library(ggplot2) # visualisation with ggplot
```

We create a random polygon as input.

``` r
# Create a polygon to simulate occurrences
polygon <- st_polygon(list(cbind(c(5,10,8,2,3,5), c(2,1,7,9,5,2))))

# Visualise
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = polygon) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Occurrence process

We generate occurrence points within the polygon using the
`simulate_occurrences()` function. These are the “real” occurrences of
the species, whether we have observed them or not. In the
`simulate_occurrences()` function, the user can specify different levels
of spatial clustering, and can define the trend change of the species
over time.

``` r
# Simulate occurrences within polygon
occurrences_df <- simulate_occurrences(
  plgn = polygon,
  seed = 123)
#> [using unconditional Gaussian simulation]
```

``` r

# Visualise
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = polygon) +
  geom_sf(data = occurrences_df) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="man/figures/readme-simulate-occurrences-1.png" width="80%" />

### Detection process

In this step we define the sampling process, based on the detection
probability of the species and the sampling bias. This is done using the
`sample_observations()` function. The default sampling bias is
`"no_bias"`, but bias can also be inserted using a polygon or a grid.

``` r
# Detect occurrences
detections_df_raw <- sample_observations(
  occurrences = occurrences_df,
  detection_probability = 0.5,
  seed = 123)

# Visualise
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = polygon) +
  geom_sf(data = detections_df_raw,
          aes(colour = sampling_status)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="man/figures/readme-detect-occurrences-1.png" width="80%" />

We select the detected occurrences and add an uncertainty to these
observations. This can be done using the `add_coordinate_uncertainty()`
function.

``` r
# Select detected occurrences only
detections_df <- detections_df_raw %>%
  dplyr::filter(sampling_status == "detected")

# Add coordinate uncertainty
set.seed(123)
coord_uncertainty_vec <- rgamma(nrow(detections_df), shape = 2, rate = 6)
observations_df <- add_coordinate_uncertainty(
  observations = detections_df,
  coords_uncertainty_meters = coord_uncertainty_vec)

# Created and sf object with uncertainty circles to visualise
buffered_observations <- st_buffer(
  observations_df,
  observations_df$coordinateUncertaintyInMeters)

# Visualise
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = polygon) +
  geom_sf(data = buffered_observations,
          fill = alpha("firebrick", 0.3)) +
  geom_sf(data = observations_df, colour = "firebrick") +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="man/figures/readme-uncertainty-occurrences-1.png" width="80%" />

### Grid designation process

Finally, observations are designated to a grid to create an occurrence
cube. We create a grid over the spatial extend using
`sf::st_make_grid()`.

``` r
# Define a grid over spatial extend
grid_df <- st_make_grid(
    buffered_observations,
    square = TRUE,
    cellsize = c(1.2, 1.2)
  ) %>%
  st_sf() %>%
  mutate(intersect = as.vector(st_intersects(geometry, polygon,
                                             sparse = F))) %>%
  dplyr::filter(intersect == TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::select(-"intersect")
```

To create an occurrence cube, `grid_designation()` will randomly take a
point within the uncertainty circle around the observations. These
points can be extracted by setting the argument `aggregate = FALSE`.

``` r
# Create occurrence cube
occurrence_cube_df <- grid_designation(
  observations = observations_df,
  grid = grid_df,
  seed = 123)

# Get sampled points within uncertainty circle
sampled_points <- grid_designation(
  observations = observations_df,
  grid = grid_df,
  aggregate = FALSE,
  seed = 123)

# Visualise grid designation
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = occurrence_cube_df, linewidth = 1) +
  geom_sf_text(data = occurrence_cube_df, aes(label = n)) +
  geom_sf(data = buffered_observations,
          fill = alpha("firebrick", 0.3)) +
  geom_sf(data = sampled_points, colour = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = observations_df, colour = "firebrick") +
  labs(x = "", y = "", fill = "n") +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src="man/figures/readme-grid-designation-1.png" width="80%" />

The output gives the number of observations per grid cell and minimal
coordinate uncertainty per grid cell.

``` r
# Visualise minimal coordinate uncertainty
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = occurrence_cube_df, aes(fill = min_coord_uncertainty),
          alpha = 0.5, linewidth = 1) +
  geom_sf_text(data = occurrence_cube_df, aes(label = n)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(type = "viridis") +
  labs(x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal()
```
